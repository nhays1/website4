	//TODO this controler will take username and password from servlet and check or reject the information
	// if the information is invalid it should throw an exception to the servlet which will send the message to the user\
	//
	//im not sure wether we will store the user object directly in the database or just store the user data then create a new user object with
	// that information uppon log in     our choice on this isue will heavly affect this class
	//however we can still write the code that comunictaes with the servlet and verifies the information/ throws exceptions
